For the final project, I want to gather ideas for using muscle sensors to help exercise. The current idea is to use muscle sensor to collect
one guy's emg signal and use that signal to control other people's muscle. I haven't thought out the specific application yet, for which i 
should have better understanding of the danger & how the system work. Any new thought will be updated here.

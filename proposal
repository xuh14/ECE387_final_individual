For the final project, I am gathering ideas for using muscle sensors to help exercise. 
The current idea is to use muscle sensor to collect one guy's emg signal and use that signal to control other people's muscle
to implement a "coach" mode, that can let people feel the specific part of muscle they want to exercise.
I haven't thought out the specific application yet, for which i should have better understanding 
of the danger & how the system work. Any new thought will be updated here.
